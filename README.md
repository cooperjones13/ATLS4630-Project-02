## Milestone 01 - Project Proposal

### Project Description
I will be making a portfolio for all my web development projects. I really want this project to not only showcase my past projects but be itself a showcase of the skills I have developed over the past semester. I plan to make my project utilizing Next.js in case I want to utilize the full stack capabilities in the future.

### Project Inspiration
- [Lando Norris Website](https://landonorris.com/) - Utilizes some crazy 3d rendering and animations to create a unique experience. I'm not expecting to do something on this level by myself during the time frame, but I really love the interactivity.
- [Kasia Siwosz](https://www.kasiasiwosz.com/) - I love the scroll effects and visual aesthetic. I hope to emulate some of these effects and explore some libraries that help with that.
- [Swaraj Singh](https://portfolio-25-phi.vercel.app/) - I really love the slight effects that take this simple layout and make it feel more alive and interactive. The parallax effect sells the site as much more impressive and dynamic.

### Wireframe
My final project might look a good bit different than this but my initial wireframe is very simple with 4 major sections:
1. Jumbotron/Hero Section - A visually appealing piece of content that catches the eye and invites the user to explore the rest of the page. I'm looking to possibly work with Three.js for this.
2. Project Section - I have a couple projects that I'm proud enough of to put on my portfolio. I want this section to have small eye catching imagery of each project. Stretch goal would be to have individual pages for each Project
3. About Section - This section will just contain some information about myself, personal interests, career goals, and technical proficiencies
4. Contact Section - Includes a classic contact form along with socials (Github, Linkedin, etc.)

### Project Goals

- Milestone 2: Prototyping / Proof of Concept
  - Fairly static layout w/o any fancy animations or anything, static jumbotron section, just my name and a blurb about me
- Milestone 3: Minimum Viable Product
  - Dynamic Product, including some parralax effects, scroll effects
  - Solid visual design, consistent design language, and interesting color palette
- Stretch Goals
  - Three.js interactive jumbotron - mouseover effects
  - Dynamic made pages for projects - possible database integration for the data

## Project Milestone 2

I want to start out this blog post by saying that I'm not quite happy with the amount of progress that I've made on this project thus far. I've started and scrapped several versions of this project up to this point. I tried using some custom components that didn't play nicely with each other and also felt that just utilizing a library felt like a cop out - although I know in a real world project, utilizing prebuilt components is the best way to stay on time and on budget while reducing the amount of bugs. This project, as a portfolio, is a reflection of me and a representation of my skill. So I want to spend some more time fleshing out some of the ideas that I have tried. 

One thing that I am proud of is implementing some 3d graphics using Three.js - I'm not sure if that will be a part of the final result but I'm glad I figured it out.

## Project Milestone 3

I think that making a portfolio has to be one of the toughest creative challenges, I have to figure out MY brand while balancing inevitable scope creep. It's easy for me to want to go overboard and add all the bells and whistles because I want my portfolio to reflect my skill as a developer, but in the end I opted for a more simple version of the portfolio site for this milestone. There isn't too much in the way of interactivity compared to earlier versions of the site. Eventually I want to remedy that and add in some interactive hero element up by name. I don't have all of my Project descriptions, and it would be really cool to include some more photos and videos around these portfolio projects, but I just kept it simple by linking to an already existing blog.

This project taught me how to do dynamic routing using Next.js, how to integrate some prebuilt components, vastly improved my capabilities in Tailwind, and how to create a backend that can actually perform a function besides pulling in data. I really enjoyed this project and want to revisit it in the future, especially as I get closer to graduation in May 2026.
